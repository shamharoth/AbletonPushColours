*** NOTE THAT THESE FILES WILL OVERWRITE THE DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR OF PUSH, SO SHOULD BE INSTALLED AT YOUR OWN RISK ***
*** THESE FILES ARE COMPLETELY UNSUPPORTED  ***

To install:

1) Go to your Ableton Live Midi Remote Scripts/Push Folder
* On a Mac this will be within the Ableton Live/Ableton Suite application (from Finder, right-click and choose Show Package Contents)
* Within the package contents the Push remote scripts are in Contents/App-Resource/Midi Remote Scripts/Push

2) IMPORTANT - take a backup copy of the files MelodicPattern.pyc and SkinDefault.pyc and keep them safe - these are the original, compiled versions of the files that we will replace

3) Paste MelodicPattern.py and SkinDefault.py into the Midi Remote Scripts/Push folder

4) Load Ableton (or exit and reload if already in) and you should see the files that were backed up in step 2 get recompiled based on the py files - you will see the timestamp of the files change to today's date and time

5) When you go to Note mode on the Push you should now see the grid coloured according to the HookTheory coding scheme

6) If at any time you wish to revert to the default Push colour scheme, delete the two .py files added in step 3 and copy the files backed up in step 2 back into the Push folder

NB.  Because the files replaced are distributed with Live, they will get overwritten when a new release is installed.  
Depending on what has changed in the release, you MAY be able to just repeat the steps above to reinstate the coding.  I will try and keep them up to date with the latest release, however, this can't be guaranteed.  Caveat Emptor!
